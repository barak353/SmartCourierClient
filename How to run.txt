Running the Angular 2/5 CLI project.

For more information about Angular CLI check out the official website at https://cli.angular.io/.

1.Install NodeJS (> v6.9) and NPM (> v3) from https://nodejs.org/en/download/, you can check the versions you have installed by running node -v and npm -v from the command line.
 
2.Install Angular CLI by running npm install -g @angular/cli
 
3.Download the project source code from https://github.com/cornflourblue/angular2-registration-login-example-cli (located at: C:\Users\barak\Documents\angular2-registration-login-example-cli-master)
 
4.Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
 
5.Start the application by running:
ng serve —-ssl true
from the command line in the project root folder.
 
6.Browse to https://localhost:4200 to test your application.
 
7.Maybe i added more packages that need to be install such as boost. So, if something is not working well consider install those package. Pleasae install the right version of those package by looking at file that does all the imports in the project. Search on google on how to install them if needed.

8. If bootsstrap is missing install it by: npm install bootstrap-select@1.13.1

Note: you should search for "insert-key" and replace this with a key for google places api.
      And also in the file app.module.ts you should change insert-key-here (under apikey variable), to a key for google's geocode api.
